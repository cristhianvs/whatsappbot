# Development Status

## Project Overview
**Repository**: https://github.com/cristhianvs/whatsappbot  
**Status**: Phase 1 Complete ‚úÖ  
**Last Updated**: 2025-01-29

## Implementation Progress

### ‚úÖ Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (COMPLETED)
- [x] **Microservices Architecture**: Complete Docker Compose setup with service isolation
- [x] **WhatsApp Service** (Node.js + Baileys): Message handling and Redis pub/sub integration
- [x] **Classifier Service** (Python FastAPI + LangChain): AI-powered incident classification using GPT-4o-mini
- [x] **Ticket Service** (Python FastAPI): Complete Zoho Desk integration with circuit breaker pattern
- [x] **Redis Integration**: Message queuing, caching, and inter-service communication
- [x] **Environment Configuration**: Secure credential management with `.env` files
- [x] **Docker Containerization**: All services containerized with health checks
- [x] **Documentation**: Comprehensive CLAUDE.md and README.md

### üîÑ Current Message Flow (Working)
1. WhatsApp Service receives messages via Baileys
2. Publishes to Redis channel `whatsapp:messages:inbound`
3. Classifier Service processes message for incident detection
4. If incident detected, Ticket Service creates Zoho ticket
5. Success/failure events published to `tickets:created` channel

### üß™ Testing Status
**All API endpoints implemented and testable:**
- ‚úÖ WhatsApp service health check: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- ‚úÖ Classifier service: `POST http://localhost:8001/classify`
- ‚úÖ Ticket creation: `POST http://localhost:8002/tickets`
- ‚úÖ Department listing: `GET http://localhost:8002/departments`
- ‚úÖ Contact creation: `POST http://localhost:8002/contacts`

## Phase 2: Multi-Agent System (NEXT)

### üìã Immediate Tasks
1. **Test End-to-End Flow**: Verify WhatsApp ‚Üí Classification ‚Üí Ticket creation
2. **Create Conversation Service**: For missing information collection
3. **Implement Information Extractor**: With vision capabilities for screenshots
4. **Add Vector Database**: ChromaDB for RAG and conversation history
5. **Build Basic Dashboard**: React/Next.js admin interface

### üéØ Priority Order
1. **End-to-End Testing** (High Priority)
   - Test complete message flow
   - Verify WhatsApp connection
   - Validate ticket creation in Zoho

2. **Conversation Service** (High Priority)
   - Thread management with Redis state
   - Missing information collection logic
   - 30-minute retry intervals
   - Escalation after 3 attempts

3. **Information Extractor** (Medium Priority)
   - Vision capabilities for image analysis
   - Structured data extraction using Pydantic
   - User mention and location parsing

4. **Vector Database** (Medium Priority)
   - ChromaDB service integration
   - Conversation history storage
   - RAG implementation for similar tickets

5. **Frontend Dashboard** (Low Priority)
   - Real-time metrics with WebSocket
   - Agent monitoring interface
   - Configuration management

## Technical Debt & Known Issues

### üîß Current Limitations
- **No End-to-End Testing**: Services built but not tested together
- **WhatsApp Connection**: Needs QR code scanning for initial setup
- **Token Management**: Zoho authorization codes expire every ~10 minutes
- **Missing Inter-Service Communication**: Services exist but don't communicate yet

### üêõ Potential Issues
- **CORS Configuration**: May need adjustment for frontend integration
- **Error Propagation**: Need to implement proper error handling between services
- **Rate Limiting**: Not implemented for API calls
- **Monitoring**: No observability stack (Prometheus/Grafana) yet

## Environment Setup

### Required Credentials
```bash
# Critical for testing
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
ZOHO_CLIENT_ID=1000.XXXXX
ZOHO_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxx
ZOHO_AUTHORIZATION_CODE=1000.xxxxx  # Expires frequently!

# Redis (working with Docker)
REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# Start development
docker-compose up -d

# Check all services are healthy
curl http://localhost:3000/health
curl http://localhost:8001/health  
curl http://localhost:8002/health

# View logs for debugging
docker-compose logs -f [service-name]
```

## Next Session Action Items

### For Claude Code (Next Session)
1. **Test Current Implementation**:
   - Start all services with `docker-compose up -d`
   - Verify health endpoints respond
   - Test API endpoints with sample data
   - Check WhatsApp connection and QR code

2. **If Services Work**:
   - Create conversation-service template
   - Implement information extractor agent
   - Add ChromaDB vector database service

3. **If Services Need Fixes**:
   - Debug connection issues
   - Fix import/dependency problems
   - Resolve Docker networking issues
   - Update Redis connection handling

### For Developer
1. **Refresh Zoho Authorization Code**: Visit Zoho Developer Console to get new code
2. **Add OpenAI API Key**: Sign up and get API key if not available
3. **WhatsApp Setup**: Be ready to scan QR code for WhatsApp Web connection

## Success Metrics
- [ ] All services start without errors
- [ ] Health checks return 200 OK
- [ ] Can classify test messages successfully
- [ ] Can create test tickets in Zoho
- [ ] WhatsApp service connects and receives messages
- [ ] End-to-end message flow works
